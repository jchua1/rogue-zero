Softdev 1 Final Project

# Rogue Zero

Our project is a roguelike game which is a single player rpg dungeon crawler.  A player spawns in a dungeon where enemies are randomly generated around.  The objective is to kill the monsters and move from room to room, finding upgrades to make the player stronger.  The rooms are randomly generated as are the monsters. Players can go between rooms killing monsters, and eventually they will find a boss which upon defeat, resets the dungeon.  The game gets progressively harder and the user must try to stay alive.
