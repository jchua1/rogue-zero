# Rogue Zero

Our project is a roguelike game which is a single player rpg dungeon crawler.  A player spawns in a dungeon where enemies are randomly generated.  The objective is to kill the monsters and move from room to room, trying to last as long as they can. The rooms are randomly generated as are the monsters. The game gets progressively harder and the user must try to stay alive.
